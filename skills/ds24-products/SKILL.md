description: Use when connecting an app to a Digistore24 account for the first time — getting the API key in, creating the products to sell, registering the IPN webhook connection, and requesting marketplace approval. Use it whenever the user mentions a Digistore24 API key, "connect Digistore", creating products or plans, registering an IPN URL, or asks why Digistore24 never calls their webhook.

# Connecting the app to Digistore24

Nothing about a Digistore24 integration works until three things exist on the
Digistore24 side: an API key your app can use, a product to sell, and an IPN
connection pointing at your endpoint. **Do this before anything else** — an IPN
handler nobody calls is untestable, and a checkout link for a product that does
not exist is a 404.

## Step 0 — what already exists?

Look before you ask:

- Is there a `DIGISTORE_API_KEY` in the environment or secret store?
- Is there a product registry in the project (a JSON/config file listing plans
  with prices)?
- Is `DIGISTORE_IPN_PASSPHRASE` set?

Then ask the user only what is genuinely missing. If all three are there, go to
Step 4 and check the connection rather than rebuilding it.

## Step 0a — is this copy of the skill pack current?

Fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/main/VERSION`
and compare with the `VERSION` file in this pack. Mention a mismatch in one
sentence, then carry on.

## Step 1 — the API

```
POST https://www.digistore24.com/api/call/<FUNCTION>/format/json
Header: X-DS-API-KEY: <the key>
Body:   application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

**The key travels in the header, never as a form parameter.** It is a secret:
environment variable or the platform's secret store, never in the code, never in
anything the browser receives.

The user creates it themselves in their Digistore24 account under
*Settings → API keys*. Ask for it, tell them where to put it, and do not try to
scrape it out of a browser session.

⚠️ **Tell them to give it WRITE permission** (Digistore24 calls it *writable*).
A key is scoped when it is created, and a read-only one reads products perfectly
and then fails on the two calls the app cannot do without: creating the products
and creating a checkout URL. Say it while they are on that screen — going back to
widen a key afterwards means creating a new one and replacing it everywhere.

## Step 2 — one price list, in your app

**Keep the plans in one file in your project** — key, display name, price in
cents, currency, billing interval — and let everything read from it: the pricing
page, the checkout, the entitlement check.

The price does **not** live on the Digistore24 product. Digistore24's API
discards `data[amount]` on `createProduct`/`updateProduct` ("deprecated — create
a payment plan instead"), and a payment plan stored at Digistore24 is fixed:
free trials, upgrades, downgrades, vouchers and per-link affiliate commissions
only work when the plan travels with the checkout call. So the price goes to
`createBuyUrl` at purchase time — see the **`ds24-checkout`** skill.

One price, one place. A second list in the code is a list that drifts.

🚨 **But the product is not left without a plan — Digistore24 gives it its own
default.** (About 27 €, single payment, as seen on a real account in September
2026; look at the vendor's product rather than trusting that number. What does
not change is that *some* plan is there.) Your app never charges it: a plan that
travels with the `createBuyUrl` call wins over the stored one, every time. What
*does* charge it is the product's **own order form**, which exists from the
moment the product does — and after marketplace approval (**`ds24-golive`**) it
is something strangers find.

Two things follow, and both are easy to miss:

- **Tell the vendor before they open their backoffice.** They will see a price
  they never set, next to a product their app sells for something else. Said in
  advance it is a curiosity; found alone it looks like a fault, and the repair
  they reach for is a second price list.
- **Decide deliberately what your IPN handler does with a purchase made
  there.** It carries no `tracking[custom]`, it is priced by the product's plan
  and not by yours, and if your offer is a **subscription** it will send exactly
  one payment event — never a renewal, never a cancellation, so nothing you hang
  off those events will ever fire for it. **`ds24-checkout`** Step 2 says why the
  missing `custom` alone cannot tell you this is what happened.

**If your app speaks more than one language, the entry holds one product id per
language** — not one id. The reason is Step 3; get the shape right here, because
changing it after the first sale means new products and new approvals:

```
pro:
  name:      "Pro"
  priceCents: 3900
  productIds:            # one Digistore24 product per language
    de: null
    en: null
```

**And if the app has more than one environment, keep one product SET per
environment** (dev / prod — staging only if it really exists). Products you
create against a preview or development URL are test articles: give them their
own ids in the registry, mark them visibly in the product name (`"Pro [DEV]"`
— the Digistore24 API has no tag field, the name is what a human sees in the
backoffice), and leave the live products' names clean. One set must never
claim the other's products — see the idempotency note below. A vendor who
only ever syncs against the live domain has one set, and that is fine.

## Step 3 — create the products

`createProduct` / `updateProduct` with the name, description and **`language`**.
Write the returned product id back into your price list so the mapping is
recorded, not re-derived.

### One product per offer AND language — this is the one people get wrong

**A Digistore24 product carries exactly ONE language, and that language is the
language of the ORDER FORM your buyer fills in** — the field labels, the
buttons, the payment-method names, the cancellation terms. It is
`data[language]` on the product.

**`createBuyUrl` has no language parameter.** Its arguments are `product_id`,
`buyer`, `payment_plan`, `tracking`, `valid_until`, `urls`, `placeholders`,
`settings` and `addons` — there is nothing in there to override the product's
language with, and no URL parameter does it either. So you cannot decide the
form's language at checkout time. You decide it by **choosing which product to
send the buyer to**.

An app whose interface speaks German and English therefore needs **two
Digistore24 products per offer**, one with `language=de` and one with
`language=en`, and the checkout picks by the visitor's language. Send everybody
to one product and half your customers are asked for their card details in a
language they did not choose — which is exactly where a purchase is abandoned.

Three consequences worth writing into whatever you build:

- **Set `data[language]` explicitly on every product.** Left out, Digistore24
  falls back to the language of the API session — nobody's deliberate choice,
  and the usual cause of a German shop showing English order forms.
- **Cover every language your app has.** One that is missing should still sell
  (fall back to another product rather than showing a dead button) — but say so
  in your sync's output, because nothing else ever will: the app renders fine,
  the checkout opens, the purchase completes.
- **Each language product is approved separately**, at the marketplace its own
  language belongs to. See the **`ds24-golive`** skill.

Your product *copy* is a separate question. Sending the same name and
description to both products is a perfectly good default — the *form* around it
is what has to follow the buyer.

Make this **idempotent**: run it twice and the second run updates rather than
creating a duplicate. Key it on your own product key **plus the language** —
and, if you keep separate sets per environment, **plus the environment**
(`pro__en__prod`) — each product needs its own stable handle. Never key on the
display name, which is the same for both languages and changes with the copy.

**Deleting a product from your list does not unpublish it.** A product
Digistore24 already knows stays buyable until the user deactivates it there.
Say that out loud when you remove one.

🚨 **Which means the moment to ask is BEFORE you create, not after.** There is
no API call that undoes a `createProduct`. Once your sync has run, every entry
it found is a real product in the user's account, and getting rid of one is a
hand in the Digistore24 backoffice — for each one, in each language. A price
list that still carries the entries you sketched while you were designing the
offer will publish all of them.

So the first time your sync would create anything: **print what would be
created, by name, tell the user it cannot be undone, and wait for a yes.** Then
create. Runs after that have ids on file and create nothing, so this is one
question at one moment, not a prompt anybody learns to click through. If some
entries are drafts rather than offers, give your list a flag that keeps them
out of the sync instead of asking the user to delete text they still want.

## Step 4 — register the IPN connection

This is the step that gets forgotten, and its symptom is "the purchase worked
but nothing happened in the app".

- `ipnSetup` registers the endpoint. Digistore24 **validates it immediately**
  with a `GET` and insists on HTTP `200` — a redirect (301/302) fails too.
- **The URL must be public `https`.** Digistore24 refuses `http` and refuses
  `localhost` outright.
- Digistore24 either generates the **IPN passphrase** or takes yours. Whichever
  it is, it must end up in the app's environment as
  `DIGISTORE_IPN_PASSPHRASE` — it is the shared secret the signature is
  computed with, and without it every IPN is correctly rejected.

The call takes these parameters, and two of them decide whether events ever
arrive:

| | |
|---|---|
| `ipn_url` | your endpoint, public https |
| `name` | what the connection is called in the backoffice |
| `domain_id` | **the identity of this connection** — see below |
| `product_ids` | which products it covers — comma-separated ids, or `all` |
| `sha_passphrase` | your own, or `random` to have one generated and returned |

### `ipnSetup` is also the update — the `domain_id` decides

There is no separate update function. Digistore24 looks a connection up by
**(merchant, API key, `domain_id`)**: same id → the existing connection is
updated, unknown id → a second connection comes into being. That is what makes
the call idempotent, and it is why the id has to be **written down** (an
environment variable, a settings row) rather than re-derived from something
that changes.

**And it has to be unique.** This is the part that gets skipped, and it fails
invisibly. A generic value — `test-local-1`, `local-app`, `myapp`, `production`
— is not a name, it is a collision with the user's **own** other project: the
two do not get two connections, they take turns overwriting one. The second
setup silently re-points the first app's IPN at its own URL, and from then on
the first app's purchases arrive nowhere. Both runs report success.

So put a random tail on it and store it:

```
test-local-diw2hvnz73
myapp-prod-k7f2m9x1qc
```

The readable part says which app it is; the tail is what makes it unique. Never
reuse one across two apps, and never change it just because the URL changed —
changing it is how you get a second, duplicate connection.

### `product_ids` — which purchases this connection reports

Comma-separated Digistore24 product ids: `product_ids=111,222,333`. The default
is `all`, the whole account.

**Prefer naming the actual products.** A vendor's account usually holds more
than the app you are building — an older funnel, a second app, somebody else's
launch — and a connection scoped to its own products is what lets two apps of
the same vendor be connected at the same time.

`all` is acceptable, on one condition that belongs in the endpoint: **a purchase
of a product your app does not know must be ignored, not guessed at.** Record it
if you like, grant nothing for it. An endpoint that maps an unknown product onto
a default plan hands out access for a purchase that was never yours.

**On a hosted AI-builder platform this is the easy part**, and it is worth
saying to the user: the preview/production URL of a Lovable, Replit, v0 or Manus
app is already public https, so the endpoint can be registered directly. On a
laptop it cannot — a local address needs a tunnel first.

## Step 5 — before real money: approval

A product can be **test-purchased** immediately, by the vendor, with the
Digistore24 test-purchase cookie set — or, in a development environment, with
the testpay parameter on the buy URL (**`ds24-checkout`**, Step 4a). That is
how you verify the whole chain without moving money.

Selling to the public through a **reseller** additionally needs **marketplace
approval** (`approval_status=pending`) — request it only once the description
and the app are genuinely finished, because a half-built product gets rejected
and the second attempt is slower.

**A Direct Seller has no approval step at all.** Only siteowners 1 (Germany),
2 (USA), 3 (UK) and 4 (Ireland) are resellers and approve products; a vendor
selling on their own account has nothing to request and nothing to wait for.
Check which you are dealing with before you promise the user an approval step —
or build a reminder they can never satisfy.

Whether it was granted is readable: `listProducts` / `getProduct` items carry
`approval_status_list`, one entry per marketplace. The **`ds24-golive`** skill
(Step 4) has the field, its value set and its pitfalls — and walks the whole
go-live, including the test purchase.

## Step 6 — prove the connection

Do not report success from an API response alone. Check that:

1. `GET <your IPN url>` answers **200** from the public internet.
2. The product appears in the user's Digistore24 account.
3. `DIGISTORE_IPN_PASSPHRASE` is set in the app's environment — not just in a
   local file the deployed app never reads.

Then prove the endpoint itself — the **`ds24-ipn`** skill says what has to hold
and how to check it on this platform.

## Step 7 — `getPurchase`: look an order up yourself

When the user says *"I bought it and nothing happened"*, do not send them into
their Digistore24 backoffice to read a status out to you. Ask the API:

```
POST https://www.digistore24.com/api/call/getPurchase/format/json
Header: X-DS-API-KEY: <the key>
Body:   purchase_id=ABC12345
```

It returns Digistore24's own view of that one order — status, product, buyer,
billing type, next payment, and the management links (invoice, receipt, stop
rebilling, update payment details). It changes nothing, so it is safe to call
while diagnosing. `listPurchases` is the same thing for many, filtered (e.g. by
buyer email).

**Build it into the app as a small admin/CLI helper the first time you need it**
— it turns an argument into a lookup. The answer sorts the complaint into cases
that have nothing to do with each other:

| What `getPurchase` says | What is actually wrong |
|---|---|
| **Unknown id / no data** | there was no purchase, or it was made in a different Digistore24 account than the key you are using. The app is fine |
| **It knows the order, your app does not** | it was paid and no IPN reached you. Look at the connection: is the registered URL still answering, did another project overwrite the `domain_id`, is this product inside the connection's `product_ids`? |
| **Both know it, but access is missing** | the IPN arrived and the event→access mapping is where the fault is → **`ds24-entitlements`** |

A rejected IPN is a fourth case and has its own tool — the signature check in
**`ds24-ipn`**, run against the raw body that arrived.

## Step 8 — what comes next

- **`ds24-ipn`** — the endpoint that receives the events (build it now if it
  does not exist).
- **`ds24-checkout`** — the buy link, with the price attached.
- **`ds24-golive`** — the test purchase that proves the whole chain.

Say which one you are starting and start it.
