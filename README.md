# Digistore24 Skills

**Agent Skills that teach any AI coding agent how to bill through Digistore24 —
in whatever app it is building, on whatever stack.**

Works with **Lovable**, **Manus**, **Replit**, **v0**, **Claude Code**, **Codex**
and anything else that reads the `SKILL.md` convention.

**Also in Spanish and French** — every page of this pack carries a `.es.md` and a
`.fr.md` beside it: [`README.es.md`](README.es.md) · [`README.fr.md`](README.fr.md).
The English file is the source; the translations follow it.

This is not a template and not a library. It is the part of a payment
integration that an agent cannot guess — the signature algorithm, the event
semantics, the failure modes — plus **frozen test vectors and a specification of
what has to be proven**, so the result gets demonstrated rather than asserted.

---

## Install

### The short way — let your agent read the instructions

Paste this into whatever you are building with:

```
Read https://ds24-skills.com/start.md and follow it.
Add Digistore24 billing to this app.
```

It works out what it is running in and takes it from there — installing the
skills itself where it has a shell, and telling you the two clicks where it has
not. Everything below is the same thing done by hand.

**Neither Lovable nor Manus needs git or a terminal from you.** Pick your row.

### Lovable — paste one address

*Skills → Add → Import from GitHub*, and paste:

```
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills
```

That is the whole installation, and it brings **all eight** — no download, no
unpacking, nothing installed on your machine.

Lovable imports one skill per address, so what arrives is the pack's own
[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md): the door. It carries the other eight as bundled files,
checks whether your copy is current, and starts `ds24-billing`, which works out
what your project already has. Ask for Digistore24 billing and it takes it from
there.

Want individual ones as their own `/` commands as well — `/ds24-ipn` while you
are debugging a webhook, say? Import them the same way, one address each:

```
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills/ds24-billing
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills/ds24-products
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills/ds24-ipn
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills/ds24-entitlements
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills/ds24-checkout
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills/ds24-tokens
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills/ds24-golive
https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills/ds24-compliance
```

### Manus — one address, or the ZIP

Manus has *Skills → **+ Add → Import from GitHub*** as well, and the same address
works there.

Rather not go through GitHub:

1. **[Download the pack as a ZIP](https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**
   *(github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)*
2. Unpack it. Inside you get `ds24-skills-main/` — drop in that whole folder to
   get the pack in one go, or a single folder out of `skills/` for just that one.
3. In Manus: *Skills* in the left sidebar → **+ Add → Upload a skill**.

Invoke it directly with `/ds24-skills`, or just ask for Digistore24 billing.

### Replit, v0, Claude Code, Codex — one command

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills
```

**The address ends in `/skills`, and that matters.** Pointed at the repository
itself the installer stops at the pack's own `SKILL.md` — the door written for
Lovable — and installs that one skill instead of the eight. With `/skills` you
get all eight, each loading on its own trigger, which is what you want where a
command line exists.

It installs into `.agents/skills/` — which is exactly where Replit's Agent looks
— and links them into `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code. The bundled adapters,
references, test vectors and the ready-made checker come along with it.

<details>
<summary>Rather not run an npx package?</summary>

Fair — the installer says it itself: skills run with full agent permissions, so
read them first. The manual route is a copy:

```bash
curl -sSL -o /tmp/ds24.zip https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip -q /tmp/ds24.zip -d /tmp
mkdir -p .agents/skills && cp -r /tmp/ds24-skills-main/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

Use `.claude/skills/` instead of `.agents/skills/` for Claude Code.
</details>

Then say **"add Digistore24 billing to this app"** — or invoke the entry point
by name, `ds24-billing`.

---

## What is in it

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`ds24-billing`** | the entry point: works out what already exists and starts the right next skill |
| **`ds24-products`** | API key, creating products, registering the IPN connection, approval |
| **`ds24-ipn`** | the webhook: signature, events, idempotency — **and how to prove it** |
| **`ds24-checkout`** | the buy link, the price as a payment plan, carrying the buyer's identity |
| **`ds24-entitlements`** | the access record and the one function the app asks |
| **`ds24-tokens`** | prepaid credits, spending them, automatic top-up |
| **`ds24-golive`** | pre-flight, the real test purchase, and the refund that proves the other half |
| **`ds24-compliance`** | imprint, privacy policy, the EU AI Act disclosure, access and deletion |

## The three things an agent cannot guess

1. **Digistore24 signs with the ORIGINAL field-name case** (`order_id=…`), not
   uppercased — even though its own PHP example suggests otherwise. Get this
   wrong and every one of your own tests passes while every real payment is
   rejected as "signature invalid".
2. **`on_rebill_cancelled` does nothing to access.** Billing stops; the paid
   period runs on. Ending access there takes away months the customer paid for.
   Access ends at `last_paid_day`.
3. **A missed payment suspends reversibly.** An expired card is not a departure,
   and the payment that fixes it must *lift* the suspension — an
   insert-if-absent will not.

## Proving it works

Text cannot guarantee that an agent built the signature check correctly, and
"probably right" is worthless for a payment rail. So the pack ships a
**specification of what has to be proven** —
[`verification.md`](skills/ds24-ipn/references/verification.md) — and the agent
builds the check in whatever runs on its platform.

**The part that may not be improvised** is the eight frozen vectors in
[`vectors.json`](skills/ds24-ipn/scripts/vectors.json). Any implementation has to
reproduce them exactly, and nobody may recompute them with their own code:

> The bug they catch — signing with uppercased field names — produces an
> implementation that agrees with itself perfectly and rejects **every real
> payment**. A test written by the same author, from the same misunderstanding,
> confirms the bug. So the expected values come from outside.

They are the same vectors the [Digistore SAAS App
Template](https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-appkit) measures itself against.

**Where there is a shell** — Replit, v0, Manus, Claude Code, Codex, or your own
machine — a ready-made checker ships with the skill. It needs Node and a network
connection, nothing else, so it runs against a Supabase Edge Function on Lovable
Cloud exactly as against a Next.js route on Replit. After `npx skills add`:

```bash
node .agents/skills/ds24-ipn/scripts/verify-ipn.mjs \
  --url https://your-app.example.com/api/ipn \
  --passphrase "$DIGISTORE_IPN_PASSPHRASE" \
  --probe https://your-app.example.com/api/ds24-selftest --probe-token "$SECRET"
```

**Lovable has no shell.** Bundled files travel with a skill there, but the
platform reads them rather than executing them — so the skill has the agent
write the equivalent as a test *inside the app* instead. That turns out simpler:
a test with database access reads the access record directly and needs no probe
endpoint. Or run the script above from your own machine against the deployed URL.

Either way, this is what gets proven:

| Case | Must |
|---|---|
| **all eight vectors** | **be reproduced exactly** — checked first, before anything else |
| correctly signed `on_payment` | be accepted, access granted |
| one flipped byte in the signature | be rejected |
| no signature, or no passphrase | be rejected (fail closed) |
| uppercase-key signature | be accepted |
| the same event twice | not credit twice |
| `on_refund` | remove access |
| `on_payment_missed` → `on_payment` | suspend, then restore |
| `on_rebill_cancelled` | leave access **unchanged** |
| a payment redelivered after a refund | **not** revive access |

The `--probe` above is what the access half needs when checking from outside: a
small, token-protected endpoint answering `{"access": true|false}` for an
`order_id`, deleted again once the run is green. Leave it out and those rows are
reported as `SKIP` — never silently counted as passes.

To check the shipped signature modules on their own, where a shell exists:

```bash
node .agents/skills/ds24-ipn/scripts/check-adapters.mjs
```

## Adapters

[`skills/ds24-ipn/adapters/`](skills/ds24-ipn/adapters) holds two kinds of file,
and the difference matters:

**The signature — copy verbatim, never edit:**

| Runtime | File |
|---|---|
| Node | `signature-node.mjs` |
| Deno · Supabase Edge Functions · **Lovable Cloud** · Cloudflare Workers | `signature-web.mjs` |
| Python | `signature.py` |

**The endpoint — an example you adapt:** `next-node.ts`, `deno-edge.ts`,
`express-node.js`, `python-fastapi.py`.

> **On Lovable Cloud / Supabase, deploy the function with `verify_jwt = false`.**
> Digistore24 sends no Supabase JWT, so with the default on, every IPN gets a
> 401 before your code runs and every purchase silently unlocks nothing.

## Updating

**On Lovable and Manus, skills live in your workspace, not in your repository —
so they do not update themselves.** Whatever you imported stays until you
import again. Every skill therefore starts by comparing its own `VERSION`
against

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/main/VERSION
```

and says something when they differ.

Everywhere else, updating is the same command that installed them:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/digistore24/ds24-skills/tree/main/skills
```

## What this is not

- **It is not an app.** No authentication, no user table, no UI. Your agent
  builds those; these skills make the money part correct.
- **The verification covers the money path**, not whether every page of your app
  checks permissions.
- **It is preparation, not legal advice.** `ds24-compliance` gets the obvious
  things right and names what a lawyer should see.

If you would rather start from a finished, working SaaS with all of this already
built in, that is a different product: **[ds24-appkit.com](https://ds24-appkit.com)**
— a complete Next.js SaaS template you extend with Claude Code.
